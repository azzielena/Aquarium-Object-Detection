# Aquarium-Object-Detection
This project focuses on underwater object detection using deep learning models, in particular with the Faster R-CNN architecture. The main goal is to develop and optimize a model capable of correctly detecting and classifying species present in underwater images, exploiting real datasets from Kaggle.
